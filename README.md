### Description:
This was a project for my Mining Big Data course at DePaul University wherein I setup a 3-node cluster
on Amazon Web Services and used this cluster to perform data warehousing, data transformation queries, 
and developed a KMeans version for clustering using Hadoop streaming with Python, Hive, Pig, and Mahout.
